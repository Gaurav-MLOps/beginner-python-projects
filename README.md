# Beginner Python Projects

A collection of small projects I built while learning the basics of Python.  
These helped me practice loops, conditionals, user input, and simple logic.

## Projects

### Dice Rolling Game
- Asks the user if they want to roll the dice.  
- Generates two random numbers (like rolling two dice).  
- Keeps looping until the user says no.  

### Number Guessing Game
- Generates a random number between 1 and 100.  
- User tries to guess it.  
- Gives hints: "Too High" / "Too Low".  
- Handles invalid inputs (like letters).  

### Rock, Paper, Scissors
- Classic game: user plays against the computer.  
- User enters `r`, `p`, or `s`.  
- Computer randomly picks a move.  
- Decides winner, loser, or tie.
