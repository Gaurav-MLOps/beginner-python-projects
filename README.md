# Beginner Python Projects

A collection of small projects I built while learning the basics of Python.  
These helped me practice loops, conditionals, user input, and simple logic.

# Projects

## 1. Dice Rolling Game
- Asks the user if they want to roll the dice.  
- Generates two random numbers (like rolling two dice).  
- Keeps looping until the user says no.  

## 2. Number Guessing Game
- Generates a random number between 1 and 100.  
- User tries to guess it.  
- Gives hints: "Too High" / "Too Low".  
- Handles invalid inputs (like letters).  

## 3. Rock, Paper, Scissors
- Classic game: user plays against the computer.  
- User enters `r`, `p`, or `s`.  
- Computer randomly picks a move.  
- Decides winner, loser, or tie.  

## 4. Python Calculator

A Python script that performs **basic arithmetic operations**: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
It takes user input for the operator and numbers, and outputs the rounded result.  

### Features
- Supports `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` operations  
- Accepts decimal numbers as input  
- Rounds the result to the nearest integer  
- Simple command-line interface 

## 5. Weight Converter

A simple Python project that converts weight between **Kilograms (Kg)** and **Pounds (Lb)**.  
This project is part of my **Beginner Python Projects** series.

### Features
- Convert **Kg → Lb**
- Convert **Lb → Kg**
- Input validation for correct units

## 6. Email Slicer
 
A simple Python script that **extracts the username and domain** from any valid email address.  

### Features
- Accepts any standard email address as input  
- Separates and displays the username and domain  
- Simple command-line interface

## 7. Python Quiz Game  

### Description  
This is a simple **multiple-choice quiz game** built in Python.  
The program asks the user 10 general knowledge questions, each with four options (A, B, C, D).  
Users enter their answers, and the program immediately tells them if they are correct.  

At the end of the quiz, it shows:  
- The correct answers  
- The user's guesses  
- The final score in percentage  

### Features  
- 10 multiple-choice questions  
- Instant feedback after each answer  
- Shows all correct answers vs. user guesses at the end  
- Calculates score as a percentage  
- Beginner-friendly Python project

## Credit Card Validator

A simple Python script to **check the validity of a credit card number** using the **Luhn Algorithm**.  
The program handles credit card numbers with or without spaces or dashes.  

### Features
- Validates credit card numbers using the Luhn Algorithm  
- Supports input with spaces or dashes  
- Simple command-line interface
