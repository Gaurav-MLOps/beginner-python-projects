A collection of small projects I built while learning the basics of Python.  
These helped me practice loops, conditionals, user input, and simple logic.

### Features
- Convert **Kg → Lb**
- Convert **Lb → Kg**
- Input validation for correct units

## 6. Email Slicer

A simple Python program that extracts the **username** and **domain** from an email address.  
This project is part of my **Beginner Python Projects** series.

## 7. Python Quiz Game  

### Description  
This is a simple **multiple-choice quiz game** built in Python.

Users enter their answers, and the program immediately tells them if they are correct.  

At the end of the quiz, it shows:  
- The correct answers  
- The user's guesses  
- The final score in percentage  

### Features  
- 10 multiple-choice questions  
- Instant feedback after each answer  
- Shows all correct answers vs. user guesses at the end  
- Calculates score as a percentage  
- Beginner-friendly Python project
